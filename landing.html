								<h3>UNIT 5</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In the world of technology and business operations online security and managing potential
								risks play a crucial role for companies in every sector out there.Security protocols and
								guidelines serve as tools to assist companies in safeguarding their resources
								maintaining regulatory compliance and reducing potential threats.These protocols are
								often customized to suit the needs of different industries.For example, in the
								healthcare industry the regulations outlined by the Health Insurance Portability and
								Accountability Act(HIPAA)b govern the protection of information.Whereas in the finance
								sector the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard(PCI DSS)d is enforced to ensure
								the security of payment details.

								The way security standards influence how companies carry out security and risk
								evaluations is crucially substantial. Operating like a guideline to pinpoint risks
								accurately and take action to lessen them ensures that security procedures are thorough
								and in line with regulatory standards. Known benchmarks such as ISO 27001 and NIST SP
								800 53, alongside PCI DSS and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) present
								adaptable recommendations that cater to different sectors requirements.

								To determine the security standard, for your organizations needs accurately entails
								grasping the unique risks it faces and complying with relevant regulations and industry
								norms effectively. By incorporating these standards into threat models and aligning
								security strategies accordingly with industry demands can strengthen your organizations
								defense against threats. Uphold regulatory compliance more effectively.

							<p>This unit explores how the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other security
								standards play a role, in shaping risk management strategies for protecting data privacy
								and security measures. Through analyzing real life case studies related to GDPR
								compliance issues and breaches of data or consent protocols in scenarios students gain
								insight into the application of these regulations. Additionally discussed are standards
								such as PCI DSS that focus on safeguard financial data security and guide students on
								their effective implementation, within diverse environments.
								Students are taught how to provide guidance to companies regarding adherence to
								regulations by suggesting measures such as securing data through encryption techniques
								and conducting assessments along with staff training to minimize hazards. They learn how
								to incorporate these guidelines into security and risk management schemes to guarantee
								adherence to laws and robust safeguarding of data.
								This module offers insights for implementing GDPR and other guidelines to develop
								security plans safeguarding company data and fulfilling legal obligations.

							<p>In this module students will be learning about quantitative risk modeling (QRM) which's a
								technique that applies statistical methods to evaluate and measure risks effectively.
								The module will cover strategies, like Monte Carlo simulations that use probabilities to
								estimate events through random sampling and methods based on Bayes theorem that adjust
								risk forecasts with new information. Additionally the module will delve into decision
								analysis techniques such, as TOPSIS,AHP and ANPin order to support decision making by
								considering a variety of factors.
								By the conclusion of this module or section of study students will acquire the skills to
								utilize these QRM methods in developing risk models and assessing their advantages and
								limitations. They develop the capacity to select the approach depending on the
								circumstances enhancing their ability to make decisions and manage risks effectively.
