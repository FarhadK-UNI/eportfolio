								<h3>UNIT 1</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Keeping an organizations information, systems and assets safe, from threats is an aspect
								of
								security. Similarly risk management involves identifying, evaluating and addressing
								risks that
								could hinder the organizations objectives.
								Key elements in this area include recognizing threats and weaknesses as conducting risk
								assessments and implementing mitigation strategies. These tasks are vital for
								identifying risks
								and managing them through security measures and strategic planning.
								The risk management process follows an approach that includes identifying, assessing,
								mitigating
								and monitoring risks to effectively handle them. Proficiency in this process empowers
								organizations to protect their operations while striving towards their targets.
								Having a grasp of these concepts enables individuals to assess and mitigate risks using
								approaches and to choose the appropriate security protocols and risk management
								practices, for
								specific scenarios.</p>

								<h3>UNIT 2</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This section delves into the Risk Management Process (RMP) and how different assessment
								types Qualitative and Quantitative approaches impact it. The RMP is a way of
								identifying, evaluating and addressing risks that could impact an organizations goals.
								It's important to grasp the distinctions, between Qualitative and Quantitative
								assessments because each offers insights and influences decision making.
								Qualitative assessments are centered on opinions and evaluations based on experience
								while Quantitative assessments depend on data and statistical analysis. Both methods are
								essential for gaining an understanding of risks with the choice between them dependent
								on the circumstances and available information.
								Moreover the section highlights the importance of involving users in the RMP. Engaging
								users, in this process can result in risk identification and better implementation of
								risk reduction strategies. By including those impacted by risks the RMP becomes not
								thorough but practical and aligned with the organizations requirements.
								In essence this section equips you to differentiate between assessment techniques
								appreciate user involvement significance and comprehend implications of risk reduction
								efforts within an organization.

								<h3>UNIT 3</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In this module we'll explore the concepts of threats and vulnerabilities highlighting
								their distinctions to lay a groundwork, for threat modeling. We'll discuss methods for
								threat modeling, including STRIDE, DREAD and attack trees each providing ways to
								identify, evaluate and mitigate potential security risks. You'll not learn how to
								utilize these techniques but also how to utilize different resources and guides that
								offer practical guidance for their implementation. This section will also address how to
								select the method for security scenarios and when it might be beneficial to combine
								multiple methods for a more thorough threat assessment. By the conclusion of this module
								you'll be equipped with the expertise to recommend tailored strategies, for threat
								modeling and bolster security measures in settings.

								<h3>UNIT 4</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This section focuses on the tools and resources that help with threat analysis and
								control. We will start by exploring tools used for threat analysis, which include both
								publicly accessible options. Understanding these tools is crucial, in identifying
								security risks and planning responses.
								We will examine tools to learn about their practical uses and limitations. Tools like
								open source threat analysis software and threat intelligence databases will be reviewed
								to gauge how useful they are in situations.
								Practical exercises will involve creating threat models based on given scenarios. This
								hands on approach allows you to apply knowledge and see how different tools can be
								applied to real world security issues.
								By the end of this section you should be able to;
								1. Identify Key Tools and Resources; Use tools and resources for threat analysis.
								2. Choose Appropriate Tools; Decide on the tool, for different threat analysis scenarios
								based on their features and abilities.
								3. Critically Assess Tools; Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of tools to
								effectively address security risks.
								This section aims to provide you with the knowledge and skills needed for threat
								analysis and control preparing you for handling security challenges in situations.
